Final Project Report
Team’s Goals:
    Team Leviathan set out to create a complete player package with various features including movement, 
        jumping, falling, walkable angles, ledge mechanics, gliding, air dashing, 2 item interactions 
        (coins and gravity modifier), and a game timer. We also set out to create a camera control system, 
        sound effects and background music, physics and collision detection, and informative GUI elements. 
        Our game design focuses on manipulating the player movement mechanics and low gravity interactables 
        in order to reach areas containing coins. The more coins the player collects within the game’s time 
        limit, the higher the player’s score.
What was easier than expected?
    Some elements such dashing, gliding, and ledge mechanics were easier than originally anticipated. This 
        was mainly due to the fact that these features were implemented later on once we had acquired knowledge 
        by struggling to implement other mechanics. For example, coin interaction took some time to implement 
        but then the ledge mechanics and the gravity interactable became easier due to acquired understanding 
        of godot’s structure and API.
What was harder than expected?
    Smooth player movement. This feature, taken for granted in so many games today, proved much harder than 
        anticipated. Also updating the GUI proved more challenging than we expected due to godot’s String 
        bject vs c++ strings, which caused some confusion in our team.
